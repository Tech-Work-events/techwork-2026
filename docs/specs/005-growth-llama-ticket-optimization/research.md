# Research: Growth heuristics & references (005)

## Inputs

-   Spec: ./spec.md
-   Site audit (initial): mobile nav, hero, tickets visibility, SEO/OG, consent, performance

## Heuristics (conversion)

-   Above-the-fold CTA on mobile, immediate clarity (what/when/where/why).
-   Repeated CTA and sticky access; minimize friction; social proof near CTA.
-   Maintain brand delight (llama) but keep copy concise and scannable.
-   Preserve UTM/ref parameters throughout user journey to ticketing.

## Benchmarks (qualitative)

-   Eventbrite high-converting event pages: clear hero + direct CTA + concise proof.
-   Tech community events (local): testimonials, sponsor logos, venue clarity.
-   Best-in-class mobile nav drawers with primary CTA at top.

## Risks

-   Over-animating hurting LCP/CLS.
-   CTA clutter if repeated too aggressively; tune thresholds.
-   Inconsistent tone across pages; provide copy guidelines.

## Assets Needed

-   Llama-themed OG images; square/landscape variants.
-   Logos/sponsors (early partners), 3â€“5 quotes, gallery highlights.
-   Ticketing URL(s), UTM scheme.

## Open Questions (carry from spec)

-   Provider, pricing, refunds, analytics stack additions, email provider, referral codes, FR/EN.

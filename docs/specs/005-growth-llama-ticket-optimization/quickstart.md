# Quickstart: Reviewing & validating the growth plan (005)

## How to review

1. Read the spec (WHAT/WHY) then this plan (scope & guardrails)
2. Answer Clarifications in spec to unblock pricing/refund/provider decisions
3. Confirm copy tone (llama) and CTA label variants to start with

## How to validate changes

-   Local run: check mobile above-the-fold CTA visibility, sticky behavior
-   Verify UTM propagation: visit with ?utm_source=test and click CTA â†’ ensure params remain
-   Check OG previews: share homepage URL in Slack/Twitter card validator
-   Performance spot check (mobile): LCP, CLS within budgets
-   Accessibility: keyboard focus, contrast, reduced motion

## Deliverables by milestone

-   M1: CTA everywhere + sticky + UTM
-   M2: Tickets block + proof + FAQ on homepage
-   M3: Page-wide CTA rollouts + OG/meta tuning
-   M4: Copy refinements & experiment flags

## Sign-off checklist

-   CTA present + visible on all key pages
-   Tickets section communicates value & trust
-   Analytics events respect consent + UTM preserved
-   Brand tone is playful llama & professional

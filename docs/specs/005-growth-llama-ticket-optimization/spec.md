## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

-   ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT we change to maximize ticket sales and WHY it helps users convert
-   ‚ùå Avoid HOW (no code/stack details here; that goes to /plan and /implement)
-   üë• Audience: business, content, design, growth

### Section Requirements

-   Mandatory sections are completed; optional sections included only if relevant.
-   All ambiguities marked with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION].

---

## Context & Goals (business)

-   Identity: playful, fun, offbeat "llama" theme.
-   Event value: share, network, learn; a hybrid between an afterwork vibe and a one‚Äëday tech event.
-   Primary business goal: maximize paid ticket conversions on web.
-   Secondary goals: collect qualified emails (lead capture), encourage sharing/referrals, build social proof.

### Target Audiences (hypotheses)

-   Tech professionals (developers, product, data, cloud), local community in Lyon + region.
-   Company buyers (team leads/HR who may buy multiple tickets). [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Are team/group purchases supported operationally?]

### Key Conversion Moments

-   Repeated primary CTA sections across pages.

## Clarifications Requested

1. Ticketing provider and flow: HelloAsso, BilletWeb, Eventbrite, custom? Deep link parameters? Return URL? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
2. Pricing model: early-bird, standard, late, group discounts? Display of remaining stock/capacity? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
3. Exact event date/time and venue confirmation for copy. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
4. Refund/cancellation policy to present as trust element. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
5. Analytics stack (GA4, Plausible currently present, pixels: LinkedIn/Twitter/Meta)? Consent handling? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
6. Email capture: provider (Brevo/Mailchimp/etc.), double opt‚Äëin, copy/timing (footer, exit-intent, post-purchase). [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
7. Referral/discount codes support and constraints. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
8. Language strategy: FR only or FR/EN toggle? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## User Scenarios & Testing (mandatory)

### Primary User Story (developer attendee)

-   As a tech professional arriving on the homepage, I instantly understand what/when/where, why it's worth it, see price/CTA, and can buy in under 2 clicks. I feel the playful llama brand and trust it due to clear info and social proof.

### Supporting Scenarios

1. Mobile user lands from social. Sees persistent CTA in header/drawer, jumps to Tickets, completes purchase.
2. Team lead explores Schedule/Team/Sponsors pages; sees repeated CTA and group benefits; proceeds to buy multiple tickets. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
3. Visitor unsure; reads testimonials/FAQ; uses email capture to get updates; later returns via reminder and buys.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. Given homepage load on mobile, When arriving above-the-fold, Then a clear primary CTA "R√©server ma place" is visible without scrolling and tappable.
2. Given user scrolls any content page, When CTA enters sticky threshold, Then a floating/sticky CTA appears and remains accessible.
3. Given user clicks CTA, When redirected to ticketing, Then UTM/ref parameters are preserved and the path to payment is ‚â§ 2 pages.
4. Given page has consent banner, When user opts-in/out, Then analytics/pixels respect consent and attribution still functions for paid campaigns.
5. Given page SEO preview, When shared on social, Then OG title/description/image reflect llama identity and ticket CTA angle.

### Edge Cases

-   Very slow mobile networks still show the CTA text within 2s and layout doesn‚Äôt shift (CLS).
-   JS-disabled users still see basic CTA as link.
-   Cookie refusal still allows core conversion and minimal analytics.
